Description: FG-NEMs are a generalization of Nested Effects Models, which model a signaling network between genes based on the effects of perturbations of these genes.  Typically, effects are gene expression measurements.  FG-NEMs allow for efficient inference on large networks, and can also work on smaller amounts due to modeling of gene-expression sign.
